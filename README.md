## Introduction

I attended [PyData London 2014](http://pydata.org/ldn2014/schedule/),
and took some notes. These notes are my own; all mistakes are my own,
missing content is usually because I couldn't keep up, additional
content is to help give myself context as I look over the material
again.

## Original content

Some of the IPython Notebooks in this repo are original content of
their authors. They usually read "presenter notes". However in the
first instance please visit the PyData London 2014 website to
refer to original content and, even better, video recordings.

## Following along

- A static view of all IPython Notebook are viewable via the official
  online nbviewer instance:

- Please initialize a new virtualenv - there are a lot of dependencies,
  they probably won't just work.
- Try `pip install -r requirements.txt`, but I haven't tested it. Use
  your judgement overcoming errors. Try `pip install $MISSING_MODULE`
  on failure. See if you're missing OS-level dependencies for given
  modules.

## TODO

- Review all notes for accuracy, use audio recordings to improve
  legibility and fill in gaps.
- Add examples or notes-to-self in the "00" notebook, to give myself
  toy examples to understand the presentation material.
- Go through "03 - Faster Python Programs Through Optimization"
  handout and turn (most of) it into an IPython Notebook.
- Complete all examples in the "04 - Visualisations Using Bokeh"
  tutorial and compile everything into a single gigantic IPython
  Notebook.
