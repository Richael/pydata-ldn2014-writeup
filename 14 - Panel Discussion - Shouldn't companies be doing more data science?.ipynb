      "## What top-line value does data science give to companies?\n",
      "\n",
      "- Medical analysis using decision trees.\n",
      "- Helping engineering companies rent/reuse/extend lifetime of physical goods.\n",
      "    - e.g. GE instrumenting engines to predict failure.\n",
      "        - In fact GE bought 10% of Pivotal to help them extend this.\n",
      "    - Don't need much percent increase in savings to make massive difference.\n",
      "- It's hard to put percentage upfront on savings; US companies more willing than UK companies to try out data science without this.\n",
      "- Sometimes you need to push companies to have well defined measures of success to prove projects provide better analyses.\n",
      "\n",
      "## What is most under appreciated by clients about data science?\n",
      "\n",
      "- Pitching how accurate your results are and making sure clients know it does or doesn't meet their needs.\n",
      "- Best practices for software engineering (documentation, automated tests) often are ignored.\n",
      "- If you want to make impact you need buy-in from high level business side.\n",
      "    - Sometimes in large companies departments are resistant without high-level buy in.\n",
      "- Scoping - allowing for an initial exploration stage with iterative feedback.\n",
      "- Customers often ignore caveats associated wih results.\n",
      "- Customers often are deeply wedded with domain knowledge or heuristics.\n",
      "    - If you show up with a fancy data-driven classifier customers will go \"but what is this? what did you do?\"\n",
      "- How is data gathered? Even before cleaning or feature engineering.\n",
      "    - Crafting surveys to gather good data is important.\n",
      "- Customers see a number and ignore the prerequisite expertise required to get there.\n",
      "- Finance doesn't need motiviation to be data driven, in fact it couldn't work without data.\n",
      "    - Really the big problem is poor tooling.\n",
      "    - Excel, VBA is too widespread. No arguments there.\n",
      "    - Maybe being controvertial, MATLAB and R is also too widespread.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Visualisation and its role\n",
      "\n",
      "- Important to start, day 1, with any picture, e.g. matplotlib, so you can poke at it with the customer from day 1.\n",
      "    - Or at least agree that is the type of picture you want to get to.\n",
      "- Rule of thumb - customers are always impressed with a histogram of their own data.\n",
      "    - They've never even bothered looking at it.\n",
      "    - Simplicity is powerful.\n",
      "- Sketching the data pipeline (source, processing, output) is often useful.\n",
      "    - Try to make it not just a set of numbers on a spreadsheet.\n",
      "    - Give it form, allow customers to visualise operations.\n",
      "    - They don't trust the outright output from a classifier. It's not auitable without expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Customers want magic APIs or methods. What would you wish for?\n",
      "\n",
      "- Clients often don't even have data. Their magic is \"get me data\". \n",
      "    - Scraping etc.\n",
      "- 80% of time is cleaning up data.\n",
      "    - Even if there were a magic API dangerous assumptions!\n",
      "    - Want a Dyson of data.\n",
      "- Blackbox classification solvers, even if they work, don't give enough confidence or auditable results.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Data munging, data cleaning\n",
      "\n",
      "- Suspect there's some automation of data cleaning and munging that is missing.\n",
      "    - Not fully automatable but surely some work can be done.\n",
      "- But is there always too much domain knowledge required to automate data munging?\n",
      "    - e.g. sentiment analysis of tweets. Not automatable because too much domain knowledge required.\n",
      "\n",
      "## What tool needs more exposure and education?\n",
      "\n",
      "- RStudio, although R-only, is very intuitive.\n",
      "- RShiny is great for quick, interactive, publishable results.\n",
      "    - Would be great if IPython Notebook was exportable to something that RShiny produces.\n",
      "- Want to be able to hide code in an IPython Notebook.\n",
      "- Tools inevitably are domain and organisation specific, integration work is necessary.\n",
      "    - Software needs to be better engineered.\n",
      "    - All software is subordinate to business requirements.\n",
      "    \n",
      "## Questions\n",
      "\n",
      "### Part of Speech tagging?\n",
      "\n",
      "- TextBlob is a combination of `nltk` and `pattern`. Not version 1 but good for playing.\n",
      "- `wordtovec` is fast, heavily optimised C code, for Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Education vs Experience?\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"Science to Data Science\" - finishing school for numerate PhDs to become data scientists.\n",
      "\n",
      "###\u00a0Do you miss academia and its freedom?\n",
      "\n",
      "- The only output in academia is papers, and doesn't matter if anyone reads them.\n",
      "    - Now want to have an impact.\n",
      "    - Yes sacrifices freedom, but if you fight your corner you can get some back.\n",
      "    - You can still write papers, but on your own initiative.\n",
      "- Academia's freedom can be illusory.\n",
      "    - There still is structure. Some professor hates an idea so you will not be able to pursue it.\n",
      "    - No software craftmanship."
